# Limitations


## Azure Managed Service for Prometheus ingestion limitations: 
* These limits are enforced by the Monitoring account you created to store your Prometheus metrics.
* The default limit on the number of active time series is 1 Million.  
* The default limit on the number of events is 1 Million.
* These limits can be increased if requested.
  
<br/>

## Prometheus Collector Agent limitations:

* Metrics with +-Inf and NaN values will be dropped (by design)
* 'job' and 'instance' labels are reserved and cannot be relabled. If you either try to relabel 'job' & 'instance' labels, or try adding a label called 'job' or 'instance' (through re-labeling or external labels), it will fail the entire scrape output for that job, and no metrics will be ingested for that job. 
* In the scrape config, `remote_write` and `groups` ( rule groups for recording & alerting rules) sections are un-supported. Please remove them from your custom scrape configuration, or else config validation will fail.
* A single instance of the prometheus collector has a limit of 2.7 million timeseries per minute( ~ 4 GB timeseries per minute ).
* Metric names longer than 255 characters cannot be ingested currently. If there are any metrics with names longer than 255 characters the entire batch containing the metric will be dropped.
* Cluster's K8s versions should be > **1.16.x**

## Prometheus Query Service limitations:  
### **Supported APIs**
You can find full specification of [OSS prom APIs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/) .  We support following:

[Instant queries](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#instant-queries): /api/v1/query

[Range queries](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#range-queries): /api/v1/query_range

[Series](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#finding-series-by-label-matchers): /api/v1/series

[Labels](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#getting-label-names): /api/v1/labels

[Label values](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#querying-label-values): /api/v1/label/\_\_name\_\_\/values. Itâ€™s the only supported version of this API which effectively means GET all metric names. Any other /api/v1/label/{name}/values **are not supported**.

<br/>

### **API limitations (differing from prom specification)**
**Case sensitivity**

Azure Prometheus solution is case insensitive whereas PromQL specifies case sensitive matchers. To prevent unexpected results, all case sensitive matchers are treated as case insensitive matchers. Also, all the names/values of metrics or labels that are not present in query itself are returned in lower casing. Any string present in query itself is retuned in the same casing though.
        
    Note: Our storage may store data in different casing for same metric/label in different partitions. If you are using out of the box default dashboards, all the queries there are tested by us to work and they do not face any issues with case insensitive behavior. If you are writing your own queries, please ensure to have all strings in your promQL expression in lower casing

**Scoped to metric**

Any time series fetch queries (**/series** or **/query** or **/query_range)** must contain name label matcher i.e., each query must be scoped to a metric. And there should be exactly one name label matcher in a query, not more than one.

**Supported time range**

**/query_range** API supports a time range of 30 days (end time minus start time).

**/series** API fetches data only for 12 hours time range. If endTime is not provided, endTime = time.now().

**range selectors** (lookback/time range baked in query itself) supports 30d. Note that time range selected via time picker in Grafana adds up to the lookback present in range selector in the query. The total time range shouldn't exceed 30 days.

    Note: These supported time ranges are subject to change as we are still experimenting.

**Ignore time range**

Start time and end time provided with **/labels** and **/label**/name/values are ignored, and all retained data in MAC is queried.

**Experimental features**

None of the experimental features are supported such as [exemplars](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#querying-exemplars), [@ Modifier](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/#modifier-in-promql[) or [negative offsets](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/#negative-offset-in-promql).

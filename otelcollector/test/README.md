# Integration Testing
## Ginkgo
Tests are run using the [Ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) test framework. This is built upon the regular go test framework.

### Install Locally
- While not in a directory that has a go.mod file, run `sudo -E go install -v github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2/ginkgo@latest`.
- Run `ginkgo version` to check the installation succeeded. You may need to add `$GOBIN` to your `$PATH`.

### Run Locally
- Set your `kubeconfig` context to point to the cluster you'd like the tests to run on.
- Change the directory to one with a ginkgo test suite file. Run `ginkgo -p`.

### Test Suites
- Each Ginkgo test suite has a function that handles the testing object and abstracts that away. It runs all Ginkgo tests in the same package.
- BeforeSuite() and AfterSuite() functions can be used for setup and teardown. We use these for connecting to the cluster to get the kubeconfig and creating a kubernetes go-client.

```
func TestE2E(t *testing.T) {
	RegisterFailHandler(Fail)

	RunSpecs(t, "E2E Test Suite")
}

var _ = BeforeSuite(func() {
	// Get cluster context and create go-client clientset
})

var _ = AfterSuite(func() {
  // Environment cleanup
})
```
- Running `ginkgo bootstrap` in the directory will create a starter test suite file for you.

### Running Tests in Parallel
- Test suites are run one at a time.
- Tests inside a suite are run parallely by default unless `Ordered` or `Serial` is specified as a parameter to a Describe function.

#### Example
- These two DescribeTable() tests will run at the same time. One tests a replica pod and the other tests a daemonset pod. Because Ordered is specified as a Decorator, each Entry in the table, however,  is run one at a time.
- Testing the otelcollector is not running will run at around the same time on the replica pod and daemonset pod. However, MetricsExtension not running won't be tested on each pod until the otelcollector test finishes.

```go
var _ = DescribeTable("The liveness probe should restart the replica pod", Ordered,
 	func(namespace, labelName, labelValue, containerName, terminatedMessage, processName string, ...) {
 		err := utils.CheckContainerStatus(K8sClient, Cfg, labelName, labelValue, namespace, containerName, terminatedMessage, ...)
 		Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())
 	},
 	Entry("when otelcollector is not running", ...),
	Entry("when MetricsExtension is not running", ...),
	Entry("when mdsd is not running", ...),
)

var _ = DescribeTable("The liveness probe should restart the daemonset pod", Ordered,
 	func(namespace, labelName, labelValue, containerName, terminatedMessage, processName string, ...) {
 		err := utils.CheckContainerStatus(K8sClient, Cfg, labelName, labelValue, namespace, containerName, terminatedMessage, ...)
 		Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())
 	},
 	Entry("when otelcollector is not running", ...),
	Entry("when MetricsExtension is not running", ...),
	Entry("when mdsd is not running", ...),
)
```

### What Kinds of Test Can Be Run?
- Any functionalities of the go-client package can be used for Kubernetes-specific tests. This includes:
  - Checking the status or spec of a Kubernetes resource (deployment, pod, configmap, container, CR, etc.)
  - Pulling the container logs
  - Running exec commands on a container
- Use the Query API to query an Azure Monitor Workspace to verify metrics are ingested

### Sonobuoy Integration
- Same tests can be re-used for Arc by having the Sonobuoy container run the Ginkgo tests.

## TestKube
Testkube is the runner framework for running the tests inside the cluster. Ginkgo is included as one of the out-of-the-box executors supported. Deployed as a helm chart on the cluster.

Has an integrated dashboard to view results, set up tests, test suites, test schedules, etc. with a UX as an alternative to the (also available) CLI.
Includes test history, pass rate, and execution times.

Friendly user-interface, easy Golang integration with out-of-the-box Ginkgo runner.

Dashboard must be accessed from within the cluster for now.

### Installation
- Install the CLI on linux/WSL:
  ```bash
    wget -qO - https://repo.testkube.io/key.pub | sudo apt-key add -
    echo "deb https://repo.testkube.io/linux linux main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y testkube
  ```
  Other OS installation instructions are [here]().
- Install the helm chart on your cluster:
  ```
  ```
- Run `testkube dashboard` to port-forward the dashboard
- Create a clusterrole and clusterrolebinding for the Ginkgo runner's service account.
- Create a test connected to the Github repository and branch.

# Unit Tests
Ginkgo is also used the same way for unit testing. When converting the configmap parsing code from Ruby to Golang, we'll also be able to utilize it for unit tests.
Copilot can be helpful with generating these tests. For example below was generated by Copilot for an outline of tests for the prometheus-collector-settings section of the configmap:

```golang
var _ = Describe("ConfigMapParser", func() {
	Describe("ParsePrometheusCollectorSettings", func() {
		Context("when the configmap settings file does not exist", func() {
			It("should return empty values and no error", func() {
				defaultMetricAccountName, clusterAlias, isOperatorEnabled, err := configmapparser.ParsePrometheusCollectorSettings()
				Expect(err).To(BeNil())
				Expect(defaultMetricAccountName).To(Equal(""))
				Expect(clusterAlias).To(Equal(""))
				Expect(isOperatorEnabled).To(Equal(""))
			})
		})

		Context("when the configmap settings file exists", func() {
			BeforeEach(func() {
				// Create a temporary configmap settings file for testing
				// You can use a library like ioutil.TempFile to create a temporary file
				// with the desired content for testing.
			})

			AfterEach(func() {
				// Remove the temporary configmap settings file
				// You can use os.Remove to delete the temporary file after testing.
			})

			It("should parse the configmap settings file and return the values", func() {
				// Call the ParsePrometheusCollectorSettings function
				defaultMetricAccountName, clusterAlias, isOperatorEnabled, err := configmapparser.ParsePrometheusCollectorSettings()
				Expect(err).To(BeNil())

				// Assert the expected values
				Expect(defaultMetricAccountName).To(Equal("expected_default_metric_account_name"))
				Expect(clusterAlias).To(Equal("expected_cluster_alias"))
				Expect(isOperatorEnabled).To(Equal("expected_operator_enabled"))
			})

			It("should handle parsing errors and return an error", func() {
				// Create a temporary configmap settings file with invalid content for testing parsing errors

				// Call the ParsePrometheusCollectorSettings function
				_, _, _, err := configmapparser.ParsePrometheusCollectorSettings()

				// Assert that an error is returned
				Expect(err).To(HaveOccurred())
			})
		})
	})
})
```

With this, we can have many configmap test files and ensure each combination is parsed and the correct prometheus config and environment variables are produced.

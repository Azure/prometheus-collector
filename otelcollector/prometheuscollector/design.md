# Consolidated Go Code Design Document

## 1. Introduction

This document describes a consolidated Go code file containing functions and utilities for a larger application. These functions handle environment variables, external command execution, file operations, configuration management, and health checking.

## 2. Functions

### 2.1. `readEnvVarsFromEnvMdsdFile(envMdsdFile string) ([]string, error)`

- **Purpose**: Reads environment variables from a file and returns them as a string slice.
- **Input**: `envMdsdFile` - Path to the file containing environment variables.
- **Output**: A string slice of environment variable strings, or an error if the file cannot be read.

### 2.2. `startCommand(command string, args ...string)`

- **Purpose**: Starts an external command with specified arguments.
- **Input**: `command` - Command to execute, `args` - Variable number of command arguments.
- **Output**: Executes the command asynchronously.

### 2.3. `startCommandAndWait(command string, args ...string)`

- **Purpose**: Starts an external command with specified arguments and waits for completion.
- **Input**: `command` - Command to execute, `args` - Variable number of command arguments.
- **Output**: Waits for the command to finish.

### 2.4. `printMdsdVersion()`

- **Purpose**: Prints the version of the MDSD application.
- **Input**: None.
- **Output**: Version information is printed.

### 2.5. `readMeConfigFileAsString(meConfigFile string) string`

- **Purpose**: Reads a file's content and returns it as a string.
- **Input**: `meConfigFile` - Path to the file to be read.
- **Output**: Content of the file as a string.

### 2.6. `startMetricsExtensionWithConfigOverrides(configOverrides string)`

- **Purpose**: Starts MetricsExtension with specified configurations and captures its output.
- **Input**: `configOverrides` - Configurations for MetricsExtension.
- **Output**: Captures and prints standard output and standard error.

### 2.7. `readVersionFile(filePath string) (string, error)`

- **Purpose**: Reads a file's content and returns it as a string.
- **Input**: `filePath` - Path to the file to be read.
- **Output**: Content of the file as a string, or an error if the file cannot be read.

### 2.8. `fmtVar(name, value string)`

- **Purpose**: Formats and prints environment variables with their values.
- **Input**: `name` - Name of the environment variable, `value` - Value of the environment variable.
- **Output**: Formatted environment variable strings are printed.

### 2.9. `existsAndNotEmpty(filename string) bool`

- **Purpose**: Checks if a file exists and is not empty.
- **Input**: `filename` - Path to the file to check.
- **Output**: `true` if the file exists and is not empty, `false` otherwise.

### 2.10. `readAndTrim(filename string) (string, error)`

- **Purpose**: Reads a file's content, trims leading/trailing spaces, and returns it as a string.
- **Input**: `filename` - Path to the file to be read.
- **Output**: Trimmed content of the file as a string, or an error if the file cannot be read.

### 2.11. `exists(path string) bool`

- **Purpose**: Checks if a file or directory exists.
- **Input**: `path` - Path to the file or directory to check.
- **Output**: `true` if it exists, `false` otherwise.

### 2.12. `copyFile(sourcePath, destinationPath string) error`

- **Purpose**: Copies a file from `sourcePath` to `destinationPath`.
- **Input**: `sourcePath` - Source file path, `destinationPath` - Destination file path.
- **Output**: Error if any occurs during copying.

### 2.13. `setEnvVarsFromFile(filename string) error`

- **Purpose**: Reads key-value pairs from a file and sets corresponding environment variables.
- **Input**: `filename` - Path to the file with key-value pairs.
- **Output**: Error if any issues arise while setting environment variables.

### 2.14. `configmapparser()`

- **Purpose**: Parses configuration settings, sets environment variables, and manages configuration files.
- **Input**: None.
- **Output**: Sets environment variables and may print error messages.

### 2.15. `confgimapparserforccp()`

- **Purpose**: Similar to `configmapparser()`, this function parses configuration settings for a specific scenario.
- **Input**: None.
- **Output**: Sets environment variables and may print error messages.

### 2.16. `hasConfigChanged(filePath string) bool`

- **Purpose**: Checks if a configuration file has changed by comparing its size.
- **Input**: `filePath` - Path to the file to check.
- **Output**: `true` if the file has changed, `false` otherwise.

### 2.17. `healthHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)`

- **Purpose**: Handles health checks and returns status messages based on various conditions.
- **Input**: `w` - HTTP response writer, `r` - HTTP request.
- **Output**: Writes a response to the HTTP writer.

### 2.18. `monitorInotify(outputFile string) error`

- **Purpose**: Monitors changes in the configuration directory using the `inotifywait` command.
- **Input**: `outputFile` - Path to the output file for event logging.
- **Output**: Error if issues occur during the monitoring process.

## 3. Function Interactions

- `configmapparser()` and `confgimapparserforccp()` execute Ruby scripts to set environment variables based on configuration files.
- `copyFile()` is used for copying configuration files.
- `setEnvVarsFromFile()` reads key-value pairs and sets environment variables.
- `hasConfigChanged()` checks for changes in configuration files.
- `healthHandler()` provides health status based on various checks.
- `monitorInotify()` monitors changes in the configuration directory.

## 4. Error Handling

These functions implement error handling by returning errors for encountered issues. Errors can include file operations, process start errors, and other potential issues related to their operations.

## 5. Conclusion

This consolidated Go code file contains a collection of functions and utilities that enhance the functionality and reliability of the larger application. These functions handle environment variables, execute external commands, read/write files, manage configuration, and perform health checks.
